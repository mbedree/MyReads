# BookShelf App  

## Installation Instructions  

Clone or Fork this repository and on your local machine, run npm install and npm start, and the project should be ready to go.  

## Description  

This is a mock book shelf app. It consists of two pages, the main page and a search page. The main page has 3 "shelves", Currently Reading, Want to Read, and Read. The search page has a search bar where you can enter in terms to find a book you might like to read.  

## How to Use  

### Main Page  

On the main page, each category contains some books. Each book has an icon in the bottom right corner (a green circle with an upside down triangle inside), this is a dropdown menu. You can use the dropdown menu to choose what shelf you which to move the book to, or you can remove it from the book shelf by selecting the option "none".  

### Search Page  

On the search page, you can input terms into the search bar to look for books that might be stored in the backend library. If no books are found with your current search term, "No books found" will be displayed to the screen. If books are found with your current search term, they will be displayed below the search bar. Here the books also have the same drop down described in the Main Page description, it works the same. The current shelf will be highlighted when the dropdown menu is opened, or if it does not currently reside on any shelf, "none" will be highlighted. Here you can also select shelf you wish to move a book to and changes will be reflected on the Main Page.
